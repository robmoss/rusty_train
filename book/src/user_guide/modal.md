# Modal interface

The current mode is indicated by the border colour of the active hex.
The different modes are:

+ [**Default:**](default.md) select and rotate tiles, switch to other modes.
+ [**Replace tile:**](tile.md) place and upgrade tiles.
+ [**Edit tokens:**](tokens.md) place and remove tokens from a tile.
+ [**Select routes:**](routes.md) identify the optimal routes and revenue for a company.

There are also [global keys](global.md) that perform the same action in any of the above modes.
