# Find routes mode

Use this mode to select a company and find the optimal routes and revenue for this company.

The user will be prompted to select one of the companies that has placed tokens on the map.
They will then be prompted to select the trains available to this company, and any relevant bonuses.

This will initiate the route-finding process; depending on the number of potential routes, **this may take several minutes to complete**.

The optimal routes will then be drawn on the map and the optimal revenue will be displayed.
The user can cycle through the individual routes with the arrow keys.
