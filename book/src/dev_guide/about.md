# About this book

This book is written in Markdown and is generated by
[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/).

Included figures and code blocks are generated by *crate examples*, which are
located in the `examples` directory of this repository.
Running the test suite with `cargo test --workspace` will compile each of
these examples and run any `#[test]` functions that they contain.
