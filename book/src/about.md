# About this book

This book is written in Markdown and is generated by
[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/).

Included figures and code blocks are generated by *crate examples*, which are
located in the `examples/` directory of this repository.
Running the test suite with `cargo test --examples` will compile each of these
examples and run any `#[test]` functions that they contain.
This will update the book figures.

Note that each of these examples must set the `test` field to `true` in
`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[[example]]
name = "example_name"
test = true
```

When run as a test case, the `1867_bc` example will calculate the optimal routes for each company, and this can take several minutes.
Run this as an example (`cargo run --example 1867_bc`) to use cached routes and generate the output figures very quickly.
