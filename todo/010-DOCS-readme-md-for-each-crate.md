## README.md for each crate

Each crate should have a `README.md` file.

- Add shields for the license, the crate on `crates.io`, the documentation on `docs.rs`, and perhaps a link to the `rusty_train` book.

- Briefly describe the crate, and refer the reader to `navig18xx` and `rusty_train` for more details.

- Add the `License` and `Contribution` sections from the top-level `README.md`.
