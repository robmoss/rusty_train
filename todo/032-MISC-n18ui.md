## n18ui

- Make min/max hex size for zooming into constants / parameters?

- Pass `ctx` to `key_press_action` and `button_press_action` so that drawing can occur within each State's construction, if that construction involves long-running tasks (e.g., route-finding)?

- May want to disable some of the global keybindings before the first game is created.
