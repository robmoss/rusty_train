## 18xx-maker JSON schema

See the [18xx-maker repository](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/), specifically the `src/data/tiles` directory, for examples of tile definitions that are used to create game maps such as [1867](https://www.18xx-maker.com/games/1867/map).

Perhaps it would be possible to translate between the 18xx-maker data format and that of `n18io`.
