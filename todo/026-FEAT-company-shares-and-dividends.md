## Company shares and dividends

Once the optimal routes have been identified, allow the user to press `d` (for example) to display a dialogue window that shows the payout for each valid number of shares, for full-pay and half-pay.

To do this, we need to know how many shares each company has.
This detail should presumably be stored in `n18game::Company`.

Note that tracking player and company assets, similar to [18SH](https://github.com/msaari/18sh), is a much more complex matter and not something I plan to address.
